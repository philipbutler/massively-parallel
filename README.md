# massively-parallel
Aiming to be collection of resources, exercises, and experimentation related to starting parallel processing, ultimately to write fast implementations of large ML/AI models.
These are also my notes for where I'm at on them.
You *probably* only need a basic understanding of python to start with any of these.

- [GPU-Puzzles (Numba - Python syntax for CUDA)](https://github.com/philipbutler/GPU-Puzzles/tree/new_tests): My fork of [srush/GPU-Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/GPU-Puzzles): 14 GPU puzzles in a Colab notebook. I altered the first couple tests because a beginner can easily pass several on accident before realizing they're wrong (like myself). When I revisit this I'll continue those tests for more. As of writing, I've worked up to and still am working on Puzzle 13, because I'm too stuborn and only want to use the [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4T-YwsOxrM) to check my answers.

- [Parallelizing Matrix multiplication (Mojo)](https://github.com/modularml/mojo/blob/main/examples/notebooks/Matmul.ipynb):  [From the Mojo site](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/notebooks/Matmul.html). A notebook starting from a sequential matmal I don't think you can currently use Colab (I tried to connect to a local runtime with mojo installed, it didn't work), but you can either [install mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started/#develop-in-the-mojo-playground) and open a jupyter notebook, or even more simply use Modular's hosted Jupyter notebook environment called [Mojo Playground](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/get-started/#develop-in-the-mojo-playground). When I had a session with this, I first read through the document, then I ran the code in it, then started [rewriting it](https://github.com/philipbutler/hello-mojo/blob/main/MojoMatMulRewrite.ipynb) as an exercise. I was trying to keep a daily streak going learning Mojo, so I streamed it [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/raKBN8k80W4?si=K7zs4NL4CR4vmFVo), and left off where I wrote #left off.

- [Getting Started With CUDA for Python Programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sgKnKbR-WE): Jeremy Howard teaching an introductory lesson as a part of the [CUDA MODE](https://github.com/cuda-mode) lecture series. I'm only about 10 minutes in, but I realized that I wanted a better way of keeping track of where I'm at in this parallel processing [eventually large ML models] journey, and paused to make this repo. This lecuture aims to set you up well to work thorough the PMPP book (next).

- [Buy the Programming Massively Parallel Processors book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Massively-Parallel-Processors-Hands/dp/0323912311) if you have money to spend, or just [download the pdf](https://dokumen.pub/programming-massively-parallel-processors-a-hands-on-approach-4nbsped-9780323912310.html) if you don't.
